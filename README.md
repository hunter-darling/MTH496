# MTH496
Implementation of some fundamental machine learning methodologies learned during my MTH 496 capstone course at MSU, as well as elsewhere. Capstone course is taught by Dr. Duc Nguyen and much of the code posted here is built from his own and created during lecture.

2020-02-09: 

  - Added Linear Regression folder; contents include code built in lecture as well as a code from a timed in-class quiz.
  
  - Added Logistic Regression folder; contents are currently just code built in lecture.
  
  - Added Classification folder; contents are a single wine-classifier file built in conjunction with an introductory "Simplilearn" video   on some basic types of classifiers.
  
2020-02-19:

  - Added logistic regression file "StandardizeFeatures-lecture.ipynb" - a jupyter notebook employing some data normalization techniques - to Logistic Regression folder, along with accompanying datasets.
  
  - Added logistic regression quiz file "LogReg-quiz.ipynb - a jupyter notebook built during a timed in-class quiz - to Logistic Regression folder, along with accompanying datasets.
  
2020-02-21:

  - Added Evaluation Metrics folder; includes a logistic regression model, currently being built with limited features and utilizing performance metrics to evaluate model accuracy.


2020-03-21:

  - Added k-NN folder, contains single notebook with implementation of basic k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Surviving the quarantine.

2020-03-23:

  - Added k-Means folder, contains single notebook with implementation of k-Means classifier. Added kNN_model-CV.ipynb, more robust implementation of kNN with optimization via cross validation.
