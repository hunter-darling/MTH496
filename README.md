# MTH496
Implementation of some fundamental machine learning methodologies learned during my MTH 496 capstone course at MSU, as well as elsewhere.

2020-02-09: 

  - Added Linear Regression folder; contents include code built in lecture as well as a code from a timed in-class quiz.
  
  - Added Logistic Regression folder; contents are currently just code built in lecture.
  
  - Added Classification folder; contents are a single wine-classifier file built in conjunction with an introductory "Simplilearn" video   on some basic types of classifiers.
